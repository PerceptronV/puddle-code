 * tree rather than one zone. A model is retained while ANY pane holds a file or
 * diff tab for its `(session, path)` and disposed only when the last one closes
 * — so an inactive tab (or the same file open in two panes) keeps its dirty
 * edits and undo history. `commit` tabs are excluded by the caller (they use
 * private models). Renders nothing; it exists for its retain/release effect.
 * Imported behind the lazy editor chunk so `buffer-store` (→ Monaco) stays split.
