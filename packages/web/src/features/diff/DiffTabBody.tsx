 * One changed file's worktree diff, hosted as a centre-editor tab (SPEC §8):
 * the navigator's Diff list opens these. Re-derives the entry from the live
 * worktree diff by path (rather than freezing status/against into the tab) so
 * the diff stays current as the agent works — `useWorktreeDiff` polls. The
 * modified side IS the shared editor buffer, so ⌘S here saves through the very
 * same path a file tab uses (FileDiffContent owns that).
